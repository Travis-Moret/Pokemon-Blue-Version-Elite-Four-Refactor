This program is a project I created for class, that included desigining, implementing and reflecting on an entire game design. I have permission to use this project for my portfolio, as it was designated as a portfolio project for the class. 

The game is a remake of Pokemon Blue Version's Elite Four battles at the Indigeau Plateau. Each gym is inherited from the space class, and each pokemon is inherited from the Pokemon class. Each Gym has a gym leader, dialogue, and a specific defending pokemon. Each defending pokemon has a special ability determined at random, and cvarying attack, defense and hitpoints that fluctuate each round by implementing rolls of a die. I included demonstrated knowledge of inheritance, pointers, memory management and polymorphism.

                                                     Welcome to the world of Pokemon!
                                                       
                                           In this game, you and your level 100 Pikachu must
                                           defeat the Elite Four to become the Indigo League
                                           champions! Your Pikachu must defeat each of the 4 
                                           without fainting, or you will have to start over.
                                           Your Pikachu will rest and heal after each battle. 
                                           After defeating the 4th Gym Leader, you receive the 
                                           golden key, needed to open the Champion's Chamber.
                                           If you become the Indigo League Champion, you win!
